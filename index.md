## We're creating a bold new platform for technical interviews

We believe the status quo for tech hiring is broken. Algorithm/Leetcode puzzles fail to have any relevance to the 99% of work that is software development and they also exclude very talented engineers who are rich on experience but don't invest 10s to 100s of hours in the *leetCode Grind*.

We're changing that.

### Curious?

We're in early stages but moving quickly. We're looking for engineering managers and others involved in the tech hiring process to answer a few questions [on this Google form](http://www.todo.com)


### Founders

CollabCode is being built by engineers and product managers with backgrounds at companies such as Apple, Airbnb, Pinterest, Magic Leap, and IBM.
